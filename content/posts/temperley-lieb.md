A standard notion in the theory of group representations is the group algebra: if $G$ is a group, then $k[G]$ is the $k$-algebra generated by elements of $G$ with the multiplication of generators being the multiplication in the group. A representation of this group is equivalent to a module over $k[G]$. In particular, $k[G]$ is itself defines a representation since it is a module over itself.

There are two particularly natural types of representations: those induced by submodules and quotient modules of $k[G]$ as a module over itself. For finite groups all irreducible representations arise in this way.

The goal here is to describe a particular finite dimensional quotient of $k[G]$, where $G$ is the braid group, the Temperley-Lieb algebra.
